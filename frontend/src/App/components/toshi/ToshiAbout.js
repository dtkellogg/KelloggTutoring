            I am a UC Davis graduate with a B.S. in Chemistry who spends his time walking/running, reading, coding, and teaching. 
            I used to run competitively, and still find exercise to be a key component of my day. Books I have read recently include 
            {" "}<i>Heart of Darkness</i>, <i>Into Thin Air</i>,  <i>Bataviaâ€™s Graveyard</i>, <i>Ashenden: Or the British Agent</i>, <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, and <i>Life of Pi</i>. As my reading 
            selection may suggest, I am in love with traveling, and have been very fortunate in that respect. I hope to be able 
            to continue satiating my travel desires by taking work on the road and both teach and code while exploring a new part 
            of the world.

          <div className="toshi__p">
            I come from a strong math and science background. I have always enjoyed both fields, and thus pursued a B.S. in Chemistry. 
            I also come from a biracial background, as my mother was a first generation Japanese woman and my father was born in San Francisco.
            My mother gave me a life of multiple languages, and my father, and avid reader and respectable materials scientist, drove my 
            interest with English.

            a track record of being able to connect and communicate with students

            part to my love for traveling, which I've fortunately been able
            satiate abundantly from a very young age. It may also be due to my
            bicultural upbringing, and the influence of my mother's entire family
            in Japan and my father's in San Francisco.

            applied a lot from my athletic endevours. I find that there are many
            similarities between being a great athlete and a great student.
