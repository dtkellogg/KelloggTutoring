            I am a highly experience tutor, having been in the industry for 7
            years. I specialize in teaching concepts{" "}
            <span className="bold-2">simply</span>, and I have a track record of
            being able to teach students of all abilities and backgrounds. This is
            due in part to my love for traveling, which I've forutantely been able
            satiate abundantly from a very young age. It may also be due to my
            biracial background, and my Mom's family in Japan.
